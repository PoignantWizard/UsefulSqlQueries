# Useful pieces of SQL code

This repo contains a collection of pieces of T-SQL code that I've found useful.
These have either been created by me or are based on a combination of code 
snippets that I've put together from various sources to solve the problems I've
encountered.

Hopefully you'll find them useful too. If you have any queries that have
proved beneficial to you, please contribute to this repo.
