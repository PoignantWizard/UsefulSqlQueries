# Useful pieces of SQL code

This repo contains a collection of pieces of T-SQL code that I've found useful
during my career. These have either been created or me or are based on a
combination of code snippets that I've put together from various sources to
solve the problems I've encountered.

Hopefully you'll find them useful too. If you have any queries that have
proved beneficial to you, please contribute to this repo.
